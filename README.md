# Light-Up
Simple backtracking algorithm that solves the lights up problem returning the minimum quantity of bulbs necessary to light up all cells of a grid.
Given a square grid of white and black cells, find the minimum number of light bulbs that can be placed in white cells such that all white cells in the grid are
covered by light. The light bulbs can only send rays of light in the same row and in the same column. However, the ray is be blocked if it finds a black cell.

## Usage

To run the project:

```bash
  python lightup.py
```

## Input
Then input should be the following:
The first line should be the size of the square grid.
Next to that, insert 0 or 1, 0 is a blank cell, and 1 is a block.
